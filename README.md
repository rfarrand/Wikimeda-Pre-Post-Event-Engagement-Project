# Wikimeda-Pre-Post-Event-Engagement-Project
Hello!
Welcome to the README for the Pre and Post Event Engagement fro the Mozilla Open Leaders Program. I am Rachel, Events Program Manager from the Wikimedia Foundation.

 I am working with Wikimedia Foundation and affiliates, other unconference and open source event organizers, and developers to come up with an open framework of ideas for engaging volunteers and communities both in advance of and after technical events so that new volunteers and non-profit / open source communities can stay engaged year round and both facilitate and plan in advance and continue work online afterwards.

Hopefully this project will be useful by helping event organizers and community managers engage their communities year round. Helping open source projects continue momentum from in person events. 

I am tracking my work on this project here: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T176853 and would really like to hear from anyone who has organized or attended an event that has had pre and post engagement. I want to hear from you about what worked and what what didnâ€™t work. I would also like to hear from anyone with any new untested ideas you might have.

I would also love to be connected to other event organizers that you know who have organized great events or who often come up with new ideas to test at events and might be interested in talking about this and meeting or working with me.
